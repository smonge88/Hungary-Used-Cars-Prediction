# Hungary-Used-Cars-Prediction

The dataset to use in this project is taken from Kaggle (Kaggle-Dataset-Used Cars-Hungary). It consists in a database that contains 11 tables with data related to advertisements of used cars on sell. These ads are published on the Hungarian website Használtautó.hu.

CRISP-DM methodology will be used as a reference framework. Therefore, the project will go through the following stages:

1. Business Understanding.
2. Data Understanding.
3. Data Preparation.
4. Development of the models.

Additionally to these phases, the project includes a dashboard that allows the user to visualize not only the main attributes of the dataset, but the results of the prediction model. This Dashboard was developed using Tableau (https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/walter.siles/viz/Ventaautosusados/Dashboard).
